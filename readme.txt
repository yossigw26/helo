instructurs:
to run the program, you need to enter the UI calss, in ConsoleGame package.
this prog works only with one deck, if you will try to insert a xml file with more then 1 deck, it's will throw exception.
when you want to save the game to xml file:
the program will ask you to type your path, to put there the new xml file.
when you type your path , please, type only the path of the folder you want! 
without the name of the file, for ex: c:\
and then , the prog will ask you to type your name, and you can enter the name that you want. 
you can type the new name with .xml and without.



have fun playing Taki :-)
